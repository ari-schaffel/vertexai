# VertexAI Privacy Policy

## About VertexAI

VertexAI bridges the digital divide within the Orthodox community by providing SMS-based access to artificial intelligence and large language models. Our platform serves individuals who maintain limited internet connectivity while still requiring access to modern AI capabilities for daily needs including live news updates, research assistance, and general information queries.

The service operates through a sophisticated SMS gateway that connects users to curated AI models, all while maintaining strict content filtering protocols that align with Orthodox community standards. VertexAI ensures that technological advancement remains accessible without compromising religious observance or community values. Our filtering system automatically screens content for appropriateness, removing or modifying responses that conflict with traditional Orthodox principles while preserving the utility and accuracy of AI-generated information.

Through VertexAI, community members can access real-time news, receive answers to complex questions, obtain research assistance, and leverage AI capabilities for business and educational purposes, all through simple text messaging. This approach eliminates the need for direct internet browsing while providing the benefits of modern AI technology in a format that respects and accommodates religious lifestyle choices.
